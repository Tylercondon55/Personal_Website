          <h1> Tyler Jeffrey Condon <br> Software Engineer</h1>
          <p> <a href="mailto:Tylercondon55@gmail.com">tylercondon55@gmail.com</a> </p>
          <p> I have never been able to write a good about me. I would like to think that I'm an unique person and I have interesting things to say.
              However, when it comes to encapsulating that in an about me my mind drifts toward giving out rudimentary information about my life. For
              example I was born in San Diego, California, I graduated with a Bachelor's of Science in Computer Engineering and I am currently working
              as a Software Developer at International Business Machines (more commonly referred to as IBM). *whew* Sorry if I losted you there.</p>

          <p>Now that I've dispensed with my place of origin, alma mater and occupation I find myself at a loss for words. I suppose hobbies would be
             a good place to start. For several years now I've been learning Japanese. My whole life I have a been a big anime fan (probabbly lost a lot
             of people there). I had a pretty standard proegression for an anime fan. I watched Dragonball in elementary school, Naruto in middle school and
             Bleach in high school. Unfortunately, I committed the cardinal sin of anime watching... For all these animes I watched the dub version! I didn't
             realize the error of my ways until college. I watched and rewatched multiple animes as god intented (if you still watch the dubbed version, please
             stop immediately).</p>

             <p>This brings me to my original desire to learn Japanese. The simple goal of watching all my favorite anime without having to read the subtitles.
             In truth I had always wanted to learn a foreign language. My determination to achieve fluency in Japanese was unwavering. I exclusively listed to
             Japanese music, Only watched Japanese programs and talk to as many native speakers that would tolerate talking to me. After several months my ambition
             grew. I decided that I wouldn't be satisfied until I was living in Japan. This brings me to my current aspiration. Working in Japan as a software developer.
